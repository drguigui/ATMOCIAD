\label{evolution}

We have a basic set of cross-sections for the impact of Hydrogen and Protons, however, this part of the database is quite sparse and should be further improved.

Other evolution for the database include taking into account the temperature dependence of the cross-sections, notably for the photodissociation of molecules at cross-sections in the 200-300 nm range. This would require a more detailed study of the temperature dependence of the cross-sections, and the implementation of a temperature-dependent database. This is particularly important for the deeper parts of the atmospheres, such as the O$_3$ layer, where the temperature-dependence of the cross-sections can be significant.

Another potential source of evolution is for the ionization of ions and multiple-ionization cross-sections.
