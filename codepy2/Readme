angread.py      ---- display the cross section in argument with a wavelength in parameter
angextrapole.py  ---- same as above but extrapolate at high energies
readxml.py  ---- display the cross section in argument with the energy in parameter
extrapolexml.py ---- same as above but extrapolate at high energies

# please discard the BetheBlock extrapolation for now. We may want to try that in the future

TODO:
- Make these in python3 and clean the display / display an help / put a NASA open source license 
- Add clean an clear functions comments
- change the names in non-confusing ways, e.g. PlotLambda.py, PlotE.py instead of 
- create a function that returns a tabulated cross section with user-given parameters
- create something more explicit for the makedatabase.py
- put the other files in a sub-library (so we don't confuse)



Database creation:

* This is the current process for creating the database:
  1) go in the impactor/resultat folder e.g. electron/resultat
  2) type ../../code/maketex.py
  3) the images for the different processes are created automatically
  4) in paper/Electron.tex check that all the tex files automatically created in the resultat folder are there


* TODO curing the database:
--  check if all the papers cited in the files are present in the bibtex
if no citation is provided or if the bibtex send me the process
-- check if all processes have a citation

-- verify that the energies and the cross sections look right (e.g. no energies in the form 10ev 20eV 15ev 30 ev)

-- re-write the paper / notes in a better english

****** After all of that is done
-- we may want to add some of the cross sections that are in the sources directories but not updated in the database yet
there is some python files in the sources that allow to change from a wavelength based to an energy based system
