The files contained in this folder have been translated from the original files contained in the codepy2 folder (also in ATMOCIAD). The translation was done using the 2to3 software,
and some manual changes were made to the 2to3 output. These changes were mainly to remove tab spacing and replace it with space bar spacing.

Conversions were done on 9/14/20 and 9/17/20.

Note: 10/26/20

I have now added docstrings to most of the .py files and their associated functions/methods. These descriptions should now appear when looking at the help for each of these files.
